The web part of the CamHack2024 project I worked on with a teammate. The theme was 'turn sci-fi into reality'. 

Our inspiration was the TV show 'Person of Interest' in which there is an AI that can predict crimes before they happen. When it predicts a crime, it rings the nearest payphone to alert its creator. Our version detected crimes as they were happening. I wrote the code for the webserver that acted as the payphone while my teammate trained a machine learning model to detect 'weapons' (yellow cardboard) and identify the perpetrator and the innocents. When his model detected a weapon being used, it would send a message to my web server so that the first webpage would ring. When the phone was picked up, it would display live footage of the perpetrator.

To run the web server run 'server.py'.
